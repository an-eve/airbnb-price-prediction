# Airbnb Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims at performing a regression analysis predicting the price of Airbnb places based on their
characteristics.

Exploratory data analysis is conducted, followed by the data preprocessing and the model
selection. 

As far as the methods are concerned, the multiple linear regression is investigated, together with
its regularized variants, namely Ridge regression and Lasso regression.


## Data

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction/data). 

## Structure

* The R code for each step, covering data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, multicorrelation exploration, and model building, has been written and stored in the file `statistical_learning_report.Rmd`.
  
*  The compiled PDF version is available as `statistical_learning_report.pdf`.
